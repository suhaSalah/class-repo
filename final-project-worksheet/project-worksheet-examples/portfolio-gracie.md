## Issues and Resolutions
*Google Sheets - I initially implemented someone else's code. It took a while to format the form to what I wanted. I also didn't understand all of the attributes. I also had difficutly with jQuery. I eventually figured it all out. The video I chose to watch on how to integrate the Google API was more complicated and interferend with my current company's organizational files. So I decided to back down and figured out how to "fake" the front-end so that it appeared to work.   

*Styling within the grid was challenging. I ended up having to create separate wrappers so that each would react differently when I implemented responsiveness.
